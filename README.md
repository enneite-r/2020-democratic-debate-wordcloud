# 2020-democratic-debate-wordcloud
Visualizing main words pronounced by Democratic candidates for the 2020 US election.

I provide a simple code to generate wordclouds.
The data comes from Kaggle and is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/brandenciranni/democratic-debate-transcripts-2020.

A deeper text analysis would be very interesting. I may update this code if I find the time to expand it.
